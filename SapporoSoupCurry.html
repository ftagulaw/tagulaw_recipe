        <h1>Sapporo Soup Curry</h1>
        <center>
            <p>Soup curry, is essentially a curry flavored soup served with a bit of meat and a huge variety of
                vegetables. Soup curry is one of the dishes Sapporo, the main city in Hokkaido, is known for, and there
                are several soup curry chains that have expanded down to Tokyo. Mike and I are obsessed with one chain
                in particular, Rojiura Curry Samurai.</p>

        <h3><u>INSTRUCTIONS</u></h3>
        <p><b>Soup:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the ginger, garlic, and onion, and cook, until
                soft, but not brown, about 2-3 minutes. Sprinkle on the flour and stir in, cooking over medium heat. Add
                the curry powder, garam masala, and cayenne, stirring to combine. Slowly stir in the chicken stock,
                sake, soy, and mirin. Add the bay leaf and turn the heat up to bring the soup to a simmer. Add the
                chicken legs and adjust the heat so that the soup is simmering very gently, only a couple of bubbles
                should break the surface. Cook, partially covered, for about 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is
                tender and cooked through.
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, make your rice according to your favorite method, then get started on the
                vegetables. You can use any kinds of vegetables as toppings, all we’re going to do is deep-fry them.
                Make sure all of your vegetables are very dry with no water on the surfaces whatsoever.
            <li>Heat up 2 inches of oil (I prefer grapeseed) in a deep-sided, heavy bottomed pot over medium-heat, until
                the oil reaches 375°F. Fry the vegetables, in batches, until they take on a crisp, slightly brown color.
                Drain on a wire rack or paper towels. The vegetables will take varying times in the hot oil, but
                generally, things take about 1-3 minutes. The potatoes will take much longer (the potatoes need to be
                boiled until tender, yet firm, before frying).
            <li>Once all of the vegetables are cooked, ladle some soup into a shallow bowl and place the chicken in the
                bottom of the bowl. Arrange the vegetables around and serve rice on a place, on the side. Enjoy!
