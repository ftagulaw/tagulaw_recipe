        <h1>Eggplant Agebitashi</h1>
        <center>
            <p>Deep-fried until crispy then soaked in a savory broth, tender Eggplant Agebitashi could be your new
                favorite way to enjoy Japanese eggplant. In this recipe, I‘ll show you how to lightly score the eggplant
                so it cooks faster and absorbs the delicious dashi and soy sauce flavors.</p>

            <h3><u>INGREDIENTS</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Japanese or Chinese eggplants (10 oz, 283 g) </li>
                <li>2 cups neutral oil (for deep-frying) </li>
                <li>3 inches daikon radish (use the green top part for a sweet taste)</li>
                <li>1 green onion/scallion</li>
                <li>1 knob ginger (1 inch, 2.5 cm per knob)</li>
                <li>⅓ cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)</li>
                <h3>For the Broth</h3>
                <li>¾ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock) (use standard Awase Dashi, dashi packet or powder, or Vegan Dashi)
                </li>
                <li>3 Tbsp mirin</li>
                <li>3 Tbsp sake</li>
                <li>3 Tbsp soy sauce (for this recipe, I used Kikkoman Gluten-Free Soy Sauce)</li>
                <li>1 heaping Tbsp sugar</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3><u>INSTRUCTIONS</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, combine the broth ingredients: ¾ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock), 3 Tbsp mirin, 3 Tbsp
                sake, 3 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 heaping Tbsp sugar. Mix it all together. Bring it to a boil and turn off
                the heat. Keep it covered so the broth doesn’t evaporate.</li>
            <li>In a deep-frying pot/saucepan, add 2 cups neutral oil and bring it to 320ºF (160ºC). While waiting for
                the oil, prepare the eggplants.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>To Prepare the Eggplants</h3>
            <li>You must cut the eggplant right before deep-frying to avoid discoloration. First, discard the tops of 2
                Japanese or Chinese eggplants and cut in half lengthwise. Tip: While we usually soak eggplant in water
                to prevent discoloration, we will not soak in water for this recipe because we will deep-fry it without
                a coating.</li>
            <li>Lightly score the eggplant with diagonal incisions on the skin side at ⅛-inch (3-mm) intervals. You
                could also score in a crisscross pattern. Do not cut through.</li>
            <li>After scoring, cut each piece into 3–4 sections. Make sure to wipe off any moisture with a paper towel.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>To Deep-Fry</h3>
            <li>Check if the oil has reached at 320ºF (160ºC) with an instant-read thermometer or by sticking wooden
                chopsticks into the oil. If you see small bubbles forming around the tips, the oil is ready.</li>
            <li>Gently place a few pieces of eggplant in the oil, skin side down, and deep-fry for 2 to 2½ minutes. Fry
                in batches and do not overcrowd the pot. Remove from the oil and drain on a wire rack, skin side up.
                Repeat until all the eggplant pieces are deep-fried. Tip: When you deep-fry, do not crowd the pot
                because the oil temperature will drop quickly. Your ingredients should take up no more than about half
                of the oil surface area at any one time. If the oil temperature gets too low, take out the eggplant and
                wait until the oil reaches the right temperature. For more helpful hints, read my post How to Deep-Fry
                Food.</h3>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>To Soak in the Broth</h3>
            <li>The eggplants have cooled, place them skin side up in a rimmed container or dish. Heat the broth until
                hot, then pour it over the eggplants to soak for at least 1 hour and up to several hours. To serve this
                dish chilled, put it in the refrigerator.</h3>
            <li>While soaking, peel the skin of 3 inches daikon radish and grate it.</li>
            <li>Thinly slice 1 green onion/scallion and grate 1 knob ginger.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>To Serve</h3>
            <li>Put the eggplant pieces in individual serving bowls. Sprinkle with ⅓ cup katsuobushi (dried bonito
                flakes), then top with the grated daikon and grated ginger. Pour the soaking broth on top of the
                eggplant pieces (avoiding the toppings) and garnish with green onion. Serve chilled or at room
                temperature.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>To Store</h3>
            <li>You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2–3 days.
            </li>
        </ol>
